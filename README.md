# Role-Based-School-Management-System
I developed a role-based School Management System using the ASP.NET MVC architecture and MSSQL. The system supports role-based access, allowing users to add students, employees, and teachers, mark attendance, assign classes to teachers, and create sections. It follows the MVC pattern for better organization, scalability, and efficient management.
